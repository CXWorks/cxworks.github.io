This is the front page of Xiang Cheng (程翔)'s webpage. I am a Research Scientist at Meta, working on ads ranking team, especially for LLM with content understanding and graph learning.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where my doctoral research, conducted in the [SSLab](https://gts3.org/), focused on Rust, program analsis and LLM for code under the guidance of Dr. [Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/) since 2021. Before that, I am happy to work with Dr. [David Devesery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HaJWLb0AAAAJ).

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my Master's at Georgia Tech and my undergraduate studies at Nanjing University. I enjoy leveraging my academic background to tackle real-world system challenges at scale.
